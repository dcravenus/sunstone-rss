For example, J. Kirk Richards’ “Eve and the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,” which depicts a nude black Eve, drew criticism for presenting an “exoticized” black woman “naked and up for auction.” Since depictions of black Mormons in history, sociology, and art are mostly produced by whites, this panel asks the question, “To what extent is the black image in Mormonism affected by a white filter?”

With so few professionals to guide them, many of these destablized Mormons find support and validation in online communities. Learn how these communities have unwittingly become support groups.

Concepts from cybernetics, systems theory, and complex thought will be presented as alternative lenses with which to view and wrestle with the Church’s increased historical transparency, gender concerns, racial diversity, LGBTQIA issues, and member disaffection. It will be argued that movement toward a circular epistemology that promotes awareness of interconnections, allows for complexity, and encourages tolerance for ambiguity will infuse more compassion, hope, and inclusion into our communities and inspire more creative approaches to addressing our current challenges.

As part of a research project on the subject, I explore the meanings and practices that Mormon men associate with gender, gender identities and masculinities. I try to reflect on the way these meanings and practices are shaped within their contemporary contexts, and by their religious affiliation. I believe Mormon men are engaging in dialogue with diverse discourses about gender identity and gender relations, and I am trying to elucidate to what extent their masculinities and practices are being reconfigured through this process.

With the exponential rate of technological change and its attendant socioeconomic implications, there is a great need for us to raise the prophetic voice in society. The roots of Mormonism are a fruitful source for inspiration to address some of the imminent changes in society. In this presentation, I will draw on Mormon teachings and early Mormon social experiments for their relevance to our near future.

Though he initially followed Joseph Smith Jr., he eventually split with him and followed other Mormon offshoot leaders such as David Whitmer, James J. Strang, Gladden Bishop, and William Smith. Though considering Brigham Young to be an apostate, Harris journeyed to Utah Territory toward the end of his life where he was rebaptized and lived until his death. Harris never denied his religious experiences in the Mormon movement.

They often verbalize their intent to be “…On the Right Hand of God”; hence, the cacophony of confusion they all reference. “ISMs” of all types found root in that frontier along both sides of The Erie Canal. This Session provides a birds-eye view of the birthing sequence of today’s extremisms plus a clarifying lens through which to discuss WHY there are so many “Mormon-ISMs”.

It is a style of attending to events, and an experiential aesthetic. In this session, we discuss a theology of mysticism in the context of the Restoration movement by examining the spiritual gift of seership. The Restoration’s centrally-defining text—The Book of Mormon—asserts seership as a gift second only to the power of God. We explore the history of seership in Western and Eastern civilizations, and hear from Mormon mystics who will share examples of their own personal visions.

God needs willing earthly hands to build Zion, it can’t be built by celestial beings alone.” –William H. Chamberlin
Chamberlin was one of the first Mormons to study philosophy and biblical criticism and was blacklisted from teaching for Church education. The statement that we could make Mormonism true references Mormonism’s doctrine that humans are divine, creative beings, and that the highest form of truth is activity toward the creation of an ethical, just, and loving world.

The term ‘gospel culture’ has been used by LDS leadership as a directive to replace local cultural understandings of the gospel of Jesus Christ with American LDS interpretations of it. What kinds of risks does this directive cultivate? What kinds of resistance does it meet? How does the mostly American LDS Church leadership function in places far from the Church’s center?

I will tell about my own journey through a fall and restoration, including leaving the LDS faith in my 20’s, and coming out late in life as bisexual. Through this journey, I have gained a far greater understanding and respect for my Mormon heritage.

While an ethnie may a precursor to a nation, they are not a perfect predictor. To develop into a nation an ethnie would have to master common economy, legal structures and reproduce a mass cultural identity. Mormonism demonstrates some of the key theoretical concepts that identify an ethnie: a mythomoteur, a golden-age, a territorial homeland, and a messianic mission. Mormonism, as a cultural ethnie, will be reviewed with emphasis on convergence and divergence with ethnosymbolist principles.

Eighteen years in the making, a newly released book addresses these issues using tools found in the restored gospel, the scriptures, and Joseph Smith’s teachings and shares personal stories and correspondences from Church Leaders to help us reexamine our beliefs and policies.

To combat this unfair treatment, former students and allies founded FreeBYU, an organization dedicated to promoting freedom of thought and religion at BYU.  Specifically, FreeBYU asks that the school’s honor code be updated to allow LDS students to change their personal religious beliefs without being expelled from the University and evicted from their housing.

Though kings are scarce these days, and thrones difficult to find, the popularity of the Game of Thrones television series indicates that the archaic image still holds sway in the modern psyche. This throne image appears frequently in the Mormonism—in the Book of Mormon, the vision of the three degrees of glory, and in prayers that dedicate temples. By examining the Mormon Throne near Kolob, we will find the underlying assumptions of power-brokering in Mormonism.

It was still a work-in-process at Joseph’s death. Even the design for the Nauvoo Temple, like the temple itself, remained unfinished. Brigham Young felt at liberty to complete both as he imagined they ought to be completed. This presentation will discuss whether there was an “original,” and what it did and did not include.

For example, J. Kirk Richards’ “Eve and the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,” which depicts a nude black Eve, drew criticism for presenting an “exoticized” black woman “naked and up for auction.” Since depictions of black Mormons in history, sociology, and art are mostly produced by whites, this panel asks the question, “To what extent is the black image in Mormonism affected by a white filter?”

Gleaning insights from classic philosophy, the world’s five most prominent religious traditions, and current social science research, the presentation examines the best antidotes humankind has devised thus far to move us from casual concern for our fellow human beings toward interconnectedness and, ultimately, unity consciousness.

Mormon authors have not generally talked upon the Plat of Zion beyond recognizing it as an example of an ideal city. This study compares the Plat of Zion with other examples of American Ideal Cities, specifically Philadelphia (Penn’s Holy Experiment) and Savannah (the Oglethorpe Plan). Each is found to have its basis in its founder’s philosophical/theological principles, which include in some sense communitarianism, utopianism, or societal equality, as well as being laid out in a grid pattern.

Because marriage occupies such a central place in Mormon history and doctrine, though, changes in marital practices and debates about marriage have proved unusually fraught for Latter-day Saints. Indeed, from scholarly debate about Joseph Smith’s marriages to the angst-filled discussions of same-sex relationships today, conflicts about marriage have torn families and institutions asunder. Certain ideas about marriage thrill some, while repelling others. For this outsider, certain moments in the history of Mormon marriage have repelled, while others have proven attractive. Those moments include the practice of plural marriage at the height of the 1856-1857 Mormon reformation, and also Mormon ritual reenactment of Mary’s anointing of Jesus.
Conflicts over marriage have often caused individuals, churches, and families to forget the other things that bind them together. Doctrines, histories, and rituals connect “many Mormonisms,” just as they connect Mormonism and other branches of Christianity.

The apologists tell us that all is in order and that Joseph carried out plural marriage in accordance with sec 132 however, many reasonable people read sec 132 and are left bewildered of the disconnect between how Joseph practiced plural marriage and the guidelines laid out by God.

Each of these clothings reflects a people’s vision of the ideal being and offers ways to become more like that being. Julian of Norwich struggled for thirty-years to “re-clothe God” because her revelation of Christ did not match her Catholic version of him. We can learn much from her about how our visions of God can change as we grow “line upon line, precept upon precept.”

The relationship between Mormonism and Freemasonry has historically been a tense one, and the LDS Church implied that it should be able to serve all spiritual and social needs, so how did these people overcome their qualms about joining Freemasonry? How do their LDS backgrounds affect their Masonic experiences? And, even more important, what is it about the rituals, teachings, and social life of Freemasonry that enhances their LDS spiritual life?

How did they come to find themselves in this situation that none of them ever dreamed of as a possibility? What ideas, tools, people, or settings have helped them survive these changes and find renewed optimism for long-time engagement within Mormonism?

In 1853 the smallpox virus reached Honolulu and spread among natives who had no natural immunity to it. The Utah elders interfered with efforts of authorities to deal with the disease claiming it was part of the “scourges” accompanying the imminent Second Coming, and promising that their healing powers (priesthood “administrations”) would protect the native saints. Constantly violating the quarantine, the Utah and native Mormon elders likely spread the disease to other Oahu villages, causing many deaths.

While an ethnie may a precursor to a nation, they are not a perfect predictor. To develop into a nation an ethnie would have to master common economy, legal structures and reproduce a mass cultural identity. Mormonism demonstrates some of the key theoretical concepts that identify an ethnie: a mythomoteur, a golden-age, a territorial homeland, and a messianic mission. Mormonism, as a cultural ethnie, will be reviewed with emphasis on convergence and divergence with ethnosymbolist principles.

This presentation will discuss how a global Mormon feminist movement is being stymied by an interdependency and cultural exclusivity between Mormon feminism and American exceptionalism. As a result, British Mormon women who wish to challenge unequal practices and doctrine are being reduced to a footnote within Mormon feminism.

Because marriage occupies such a central place in Mormon history and doctrine, though, changes in marital practices and debates about marriage have proved unusually fraught for Latter-day Saints. Indeed, from scholarly debate about Joseph Smith’s marriages to the angst-filled discussions of same-sex relationships today, conflicts about marriage have torn families and institutions asunder. Certain ideas about marriage thrill some, while repelling others. For this outsider, certain moments in the history of Mormon marriage have repelled, while others have proven attractive. Those moments include the practice of plural marriage at the height of the 1856-1857 Mormon reformation, and also Mormon ritual reenactment of Mary’s anointing of Jesus.
Conflicts over marriage have often caused individuals, churches, and families to forget the other things that bind them together. Doctrines, histories, and rituals connect “many Mormonisms,” just as they connect Mormonism and other branches of Christianity.

Although not cannonized as Doctrine and Covenants Sec 132 until 1876 it nonetheless became the pivot point of 19th century Mormonism until it’s reluctant abandonment near the end of the century. The apologists tell us that all is in order and that Joseph carried out plural marriage in accordance with sec 132 however, many reasonable people read sec 132 and are left bewildered of the disconnect between how Joseph practiced plural marriage and the guidelines laid out by God. Could there be another explanation?
